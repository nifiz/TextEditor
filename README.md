<H3>Console text editor written in pure C </H3>
This is my first big solo project. I wanted to make something useful, and to actually
practice creating and maintaining a project spanning multiple source and header files, along with
a Makefile.

<H5>Working features so far: </H5>

<ul>
  <li>Writing, deleting characters</li>
  <li>Moving the cursor - END, HOME, arrows etc.</li>
  <li>Inserting lines with ENTER key</li>
</ul>
<H5>Features I want to implement: </H5>
<ul>
  <li>VIM-like handy special keys, deleting entire lines or inserting text below etc.</li>
  <li>Saving to and reading from files (Almost done)</li>
  <li>More advanced file operations, renaming etc.</li>
  <li>Colorful info bar at the top</li>
</ul>
